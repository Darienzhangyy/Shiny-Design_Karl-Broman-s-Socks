**Task 1**

To reproduce and improve Rasmusâ€™ analyses of total socks and proportion of paired socks in Karl Broman's laundry, we create a web app that allows users to choose priors which returns eight histograms of prior and posterior distributions regarding number of total, odd, and paired socks. We also provide a table of posterior summary statistics of total socks, paired and odd socks and porption of paired socks given user chosen priors. 

We provide two paired priors for number of total socks and proportion of paired socks. Specifically, when a user chooses a negative binomial prior distribution with user defined parameters `mu` and `sd`  for number of total socks, we would allow user to choose a beta prior with user defined parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for proportion of paired socks. This way we allow prior of number of total socks to be a postive integer which can be drawn from a negative binomimal distribution and prior of proportion of paired socks be a percentage which can be drawn from a beta distribution with a positive number that is between 0 and 1. Besides, negative binomial and beta distributions are conjugate. On the other hand, when a user chooses a poisson prior distribution with user defined parameters $\lambda$ for number of total socks, we would allow user to choose a truncated normal distribution for the same reason that total socks needs to be positive integers and porportion of paired socks needs to be positive number that is between 0 and 1. 

To implement the algorithm of ABC, we first create a prior function that allows user to choose priors as discussed above. We the calculate the priors for `n_pairs` and `n_odd` given user defined hyperparameters to get prior distributions of `n_socks` and `prop_pairs`. By simulation afterward and picking out the rows with same number of pairs as the user input, we pick out the rows with these four variables and get the posterior distribution based on the picked rows. The posterior function then pick out the rows from the dataframe result from prior() where "pairs" "variable" equals the number of pairs user input, aka, `n_paired`. Later on the data frame drawn with `n_paired` (with the same "pair" values)is used to get the posterior distrbution for the four variables. We then plot eight histograms and provide summary statistics for socks data. Our web app finally gives prediction of 44 total socks according to observed total 11 singletons and 0 paired socks.
